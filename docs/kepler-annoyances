No way to temporarily disable ("comment out") actors
  Bugzilla: http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2921
  Given long-running nature of pipeline components, a means of disabling some and testing others in isolation is essential
    Easily done in shell script
    Yet seems impossible in Kepler
    One can, of course, test shell scripts manually, outside Kepler
      But then must provide two code paths -- inputs when run from Kepler, and inputs when run standalone

No way (at least so far as I can see) to rename already-created workflow
  Mine is permanently named "chip," at least according to title displayed for Kepler window

Clicking red stop button in Kepler won't always stop external processes that are in midst of execution
  For example, clicking stop won't kill meme -- I must manually kill process to stop workflow

Zip-based KAR format makes seeing what has changed since last commit via "git diff" impossible
  If underlying XML were more easily exposed, one could at least get a sense of what has changed in this revision

When documenting workflows by adding annotations, no easy way to align annotations with each other
  I have a bunch of bullet points beneath one annotation
    I must manually space them both horizontally and vertically; even then, no way to get proper alignment -- always off by a few pixels

If I have a variable in a path to a file parameter, and I use "Browse" button to select a new file that is located underneath directory specified by variable, the variable is not reused, but instead whole path is replaced by an absolute path

Mouse scroll wheel doesn't pan, but zooms
  Should pan by default, with Ctrl making it zoom

Kepler provides three basic benefits:
  1. Visualize workflow
  2. Execute workflows in visual manner
  3. Parallelization
  4. Cleaner coding standards
