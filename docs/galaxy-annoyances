By default, should assume that if tool produces non-zero exit code, it failed; otherwise, succeeded

Running "run.sh" without parameters results in CTRL+C not working to exit

Right-hand listing of tool execution isn't terribly clear
  Visualization is too close to underlying implementation -- programmers think of numerically ordered steps, so that's what they show
  Better would be showing graph with edges between workflow steps

Error message when running R scripts:
  ProgrammingError: (ProgrammingError) You must not use 8-bit bytestrings unless you use a text_factory that can interpret 8-bit bytestrings (like text_factory = str). It is highly recommended that you instead just switch your application to Unicode strings. u'UPDATE job SET update_time=?, state=?, stdout=?, stderr=? WHERE job.id = ?'

Why does this script take 100% CPU when a CPU-intensive process is run by Galaxy?
  python ./scripts/paster.py serve universe_wsgi.ini

No good way to group multiple outputs -- they all appear as separate items
  I'd rather they appear as group, since they're related to each another, and so they'd take up less space in history
