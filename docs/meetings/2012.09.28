Stats stuff:
  Statistical power: more statistical power => better chance of *not* missing things that are significant
    If you compare a whole bunch of things, you have more likelihood of finding apparent correlation by chance
      Compare BHSc students vs. main campus bio students across whole bunch of categories
      Do enough comparisons, you will find apparent correlation
        Like, say, BHSc students have same astrological sign, and main campus students don't
      So, must correct for multiple measurements -- essentially lowers p-values to compensate
        Traditional (Bonferoni?): given bunch of t-tests, just divide p-value for each measurement by number of t-tests
        Benjamini-H(something) is good default choice for our needs
  Parametric vs. non-parametric:
    Parametric has greater statistical power because it encodes assumptions about distribution of data -- e.g., normal, extreme value, etc.
    Non-parametric *doesn't* encode these assumptions about data distribution
      Has less statistical power, but is still quite powerful enough if data set is large enough
      So, if data set big enough, use non-parametric since it uses fewer assumptions
    Historically, most stats texts/courses teach non-parametric only as an afterthought
      Reason: parametric easily computed using tables; non-parametric needs computer so you can do great many calculations

Reason for comparing TSS values with TES values:
  TES is essentially control to see if your data make sense
    We expect to see lots of TF binding around TSS, but hardly around TES
    So, if your proximal-to-TSS and proximal-to-TES areas are about the same size, if you see roughly equal rates of binding in the two, you know something's messed up

Definitions for location analysis:
  Proximal promoter: -1500 nt to 500 nt around TSS
  Proximal TES: -500 nt to 1500 nt around TES
  Inside gene: anything between TSS and TES
  Distal: everything else
Note that these sets are mutually exclusive, and that they encompass entirety of genome

Look at E2F1 ChIP-seq data sets -- should see heavy E2F1 binding in proximal promoters, little elsewhere
  This is data set that gives strong signal -- good for sanity-checking pipeline

Gene ontology stuff:
  Stay with ChIPpeakAnno
  Enable multiple test correction
    Use Benjamini-H method
  Output both full (raw data) list, as well as simplified
  Simplified data list:
    Gene name
    GO term (brain development, etc.)
    Count in data set
    Count in genome
    Corrected p value
