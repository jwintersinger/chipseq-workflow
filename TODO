==========
Big things
==========
Location analysis: Generate histogram showing peak locations
Peak examples: Look at bringing into UCSC
Bring custom actors into Kepler -- add to internal library
Build test suite around actors
Build individual workflows for each actor to allow testing in isolation

============
Small things
============
Why does running pathway analysis with "macs-example" dataset error out because no pathways found, but not with "test" dataset (which is a subset of it)?
  To fix this, make workflow tolerant to "no pathways found" error in ChIPpeakAnno
Make results window display only after all terminal actors have finished executing
Remove "shared knowledge" between scripts and composite actors regarding multiple output names
  e.g., for GO actor, instead of hardcoding output name in both workflow and script, make script take separate parameters for each output file name
Update MEME script to use named rather than positional parameters

=====
Notes
=====
Ensure I'm using "traditional" transcripts -- from RefSeq
  Sometimes we have bunch of genes together that are transcribed as single unit, then (perhaps) modified post-transcriptionally to separate
    This we don't want -- plays havoc with analysis of TSS

=========
Questions
=========
How best to determine gene expression levels?
  Investigate supporting gene expression levels for non-human data sets
Do I need to sort my GFF file for peak stats/histograms actor to work?

Update pathways file parameter
