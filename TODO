Do I need to sort my GFF file for peak stats/histograms actor to work?
Look into proper path handling (i.e., / -> \) on Windows
Investigate supporting gene expression levels for non-human data sets
Update R and Python scripts to use named rather than positional parameters

Location analysis:
  All peaks
  Peaks in proximal promoter
    i.e., peaks within upstream_nts (-5000) to downstream_nts (+500) from TSS
  Peaks near 3' TSS end site
  Peaks inside a gene
  Distal peaks (> 20 Kb from any TSS or 3' end)
  Histograms of peak locations (to be added later)
Need:
  Distance from peak start to nearest TSS (either direction)
