==========
Big things
==========
Location analysis: Generate histogram showing peak locations
Peak examples: Look at bringing into UCSC
Bring custom actors into Kepler -- add to internal library
Build test suite around actors
Build individual workflows for each actor to allow testing in isolation

Gene expression
Compare ChIP-seq data sets
  Look at Anya's paper
  Perhaps PolII always associated with your TF -- we wish to find this

============
Small things
============
Why does running pathway analysis with "macs-example" dataset error out because no pathways found, but not with "test" dataset (which is a subset of it)?
  To fix this, make workflow tolerant to "no pathways found" error in ChIPpeakAnno
Make results window display only after all terminal actors have finished executing
Remove "shared knowledge" between scripts and composite actors regarding multiple output names
  e.g., for GO actor, instead of hardcoding output name in both workflow and script, make script take separate parameters for each output file name
Update MEME script to use named rather than positional parameters

After 2012.12.03 meeting:
  Send Mark E2F1 results
    Tell him what outputs I need from ChIPpeakAnno
  Rip out ChIPpeakAnno
  Look at gene expression stuff
  Look at comparing data sets

=====
Notes
=====
Ensure I'm using "traditional" transcripts -- from RefSeq
  Sometimes we have bunch of genes together that are transcribed as single unit, then (perhaps) modified post-transcriptionally to separate
    This we don't want -- plays havoc with analysis of TSS

======
Galaxy
======
Implement custom data format for "extended peaks", beyond "tabular"
Why does rtracklayer take extremely long time to load ~14k-line GFF file produced by Galaxy with "##gff-version 2" line in it?
  Removing this line makes data load almost instantly
  "##bed_to_gff_converter.py" line has no effect on load time, so problem isn't simply comment lines
Make longer the input fields (annotation DB, etc.) on "Annotate peaks"
Adjust naming of tools -- names likely only necessary when multiple outputs produced by a tool
  Make "verby" rather than "nouny"
  Include number of input dataset when renaming
Allow running MACS without control data

=========
Questions
=========
How best to determine gene expression levels?
  Investigate supporting gene expression levels for non-human data sets
Do I need to sort my GFF file for peak stats/histograms actor to work?

Update pathways file parameter
