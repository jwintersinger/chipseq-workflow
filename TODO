Big things

Location analysis: Generate histogram showing peak locations

Gene ontology
  Do via gene names, not chromosome locatinos
    Gene names source: genes with peaks in proximal promoter
Pathway analysis
  ChIPpeakAnno can do basic form of this
  Otherwise: DAVID, etc.
Peak examples
  Look at bringing into UCSC

Misc:
  Bring our actors into Kepler -- add to internal library
    Modularize actors, build test suite around them
      Don't need unit tests necessarily -- manual good enough to start with
  Ensure I'm using "traditional" transcripts -- from RefSeq
    Sometimes we have bunch of genes together that are transcribed as single unit, then (perhaps) modified post-transcriptionally to separate
      This we don't want -- plays havoc with analysis of TSS

Questions:
  Why can't I chain multiple commands in Kepler?
  How best to determine gene expression levels?

Next:
  Why does running pathway analysis with "macs-example" dataset error out because no pathways found, but not with "test" dataset (which is a subset of it)?
    To fix this, make workflow tolerant to "no pathways found" error in ChIPpeakAnno
  Develop small test workflows for each component
  Make results window display only after all terminal actors have finished executing

============
Small things
============
Disable allowDisconnectedGraphs for director
Do I need to sort my GFF file for peak stats/histograms actor to work?
Investigate supporting gene expression levels for non-human data sets
Update Python scripts to use named rather than positional parameters
Deal with Windows path munging if necessary -- foward slash -> backslash
  Good means of dealing with this in Python: os.path.normpath

Break workflow into modular components
  Establish test suite to verify proper behaviour
