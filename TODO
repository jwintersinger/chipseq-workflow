Location analysis:
  All peaks
  Peaks in proximal promoter
    i.e., peaks within upstream_nts (-5000) to downstream_nts (+500) from TSS
  Peaks near 3' TSS end site
  Peaks inside a gene
  Distal peaks (> 20 Kb from any TSS or 3' end)
  Histograms of peak locations (to be added later)
Need:
  Distance from peak start to nearest TSS (either direction)

Immediate roadmap:
  Location analysis:
    Most interesting: peaks in proximal promoter
      Proximal promoter: -500 to +1500 nt around around TSS
    Do via overlapping regions -- if peak region overlaps proximal promoter, say that peak is within proximal promoter
      Problem: ChIPpeakAnno works by taking single point for peak -- either start or middle
        May need to write own script
      
  Gene ontology
    Do via gene names, not chromosome locatinos
      Gene names source: genes with peaks in proximal promoter
  Pathway analysis
    ChIPpeakAnno can do basic form of this
    Otherwise: DAVID, etc.
  Peak examples
    Look at bringing into UCSC

Misc:
  Bring our actors into Kepler -- add to internal library
    Modularize actors, build test suite around them
      Don't need unit tests necessarily -- manual good enough to start with
  Ensure I'm using "traditional" transcripts -- from RefSeq
    Sometimes we have bunch of genes together that are transcribed as single unit, then (perhaps) modified post-transcriptionally to separate
      This we don't want -- plays havoc with analysis of TSS

Small things
============
Disable allowDisconnectedGraphs for director
Do I need to sort my GFF file for peak stats/histograms actor to work?
Investigate supporting gene expression levels for non-human data sets
Update Python scripts to use named rather than positional parameters
Deal with Windows path munging if necessary -- foward slash -> backslash
  Good means of dealing with this in Python: os.path.normpath

Break workflow into modular components
  Establish test suite to verify proper behaviour
