Big things
==========
Location analysis:
  All peaks
  Peaks in proximal promoter
    i.e., peaks within upstream_nts (-5000) to downstream_nts (+500) from TSS
  Peaks near 3' TSS end site
  Peaks inside a gene
  Distal peaks (> 20 Kb from any TSS or 3' end)
  Histograms of peak locations (to be added later)

  Need:
    Distance from peak start to nearest TSS (either direction)

Pathway analysis
Example peaks

Small things
============
Disable allowDisconnectedGraphs for director
Do I need to sort my GFF file for peak stats/histograms actor to work?
Investigate supporting gene expression levels for non-human data sets
Update Python scripts to use named rather than positional parameters
Deal with Windows path munging if necessary -- foward slash -> backslash
  Good means of dealing with this in Python: os.path.normpath

Break workflow into modular components
  Establish test suite to verify proper behaviour
