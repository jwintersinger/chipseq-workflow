ChIP-Seq Data Analysis Pipeline

===============================

The pipeline has been tested on 64-bit Arch Linux, but should work on any *nix
OS (including OS X). Notably, it will not work on Windows.

1. Ensure the following are installed:
  * R
  * Python 2.7
  * Kepler 2.3

2. Install the following Bioconductor packages:
  * ChIPpeakAnno
  * rtracklayer
  * optparse
  * reactome.db

3. Install the following tools, ensuring their executables are in the user's $PATH:
   * bedtools
   * MACS
   * MEME

4. Run scripts/download-data.sh to download the human reference sequence and example ChIP-seq data.

5. Run Kepler. Open transcriptionFactorPeakProcessor.kar from the workflows/ directory.

6. Adjust the workflow's parameters as necessary. At the least, you must change Base directory.

7. Run the workflow.

Known Issues
============
1. No gene expression data is currently used. Though previous revisions of this
   pipeline included this functionality, it was done in an extremely hacky
   manner. If neccessary, this functionality can be restored.

2. The web browser displaying the results directory opens too early. I would
   like to delay it until all the terminal actors feeding into it have finished
   executing, but I do not know how. I need an actor that can take multiple
   inputs (one from each terminal actor), then fire only when it has received
   data from all those inputs -- this would trigger the display of results.

3. When the pathway analysis step fails to find any pathways, the workflow will
   halt. To fix this, I need simply modify the code that runs ChIPpeakAnno's
   pathway-finding functionality so that when on pathways are found, the script
   does not exit with an error. (This same problem may also be present for the
   GO code, since it also relies on ChIPpeakAnno.)
