=================================

Using the pipeline via the virtual machine supplied in my link is substantially
easier than configuring its constituent components manually. Nevertheless, the
process to do so follows. The pipeline has been tested on Arch Linux, but
should work on any *nix OS (including OS X). Notably, it will not work on
Windows.

1. Ensure both R and Python 2.7 are installed.
2. Install the Bioconductor packages ChIPpeakAnno and rtracklayer.
3. Install bedtools, MACS, and MEME. Ensure the latter three are in the user's $PATH.
4. Run scripts/download-data.sh to pull down the human reference sequence and example ChIP-seq data.
5. Run Kepler. Open either of the workflows in the workflows/ directory.
6. Adjust the workflow's parameters as necessary. At the least, you must change Base directory.
7. Run the workflow.
